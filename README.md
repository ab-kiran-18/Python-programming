# programming

DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING:

  1)  Its a looking simple and a way hard approach for solving complex problems.
  
  2)  It is a approach where we solve each and every possibility cases which might lead to solution for the problem.
  
  3)  here we have a base case buy which we calculate next cases with help of the previous cases.    
  
  4)  It is a approach where we reduce the time complexity of a problem by memorizing its result so that we can use in future without any furthur calculating it once agin.
      so, with this procedure we can solve a problem without solving any small sub-problems repetitively.
  
  5)  here we either use a 1D or 2D array for memorizing the calculated values.
  
  6)  By the completion of this repo i had learned the basic implementation of DP and where and when to use it.   
 

SEARCHING AND SORTINGS :
  
  1)  Searching and Sorting are the basics things which a every programmer must be good in.
  
  2)  by the completion time of this repo i learnt about the time and space complexities of Search and Sort algorithms.
  
  3)  I mainly understood how the steps are being processed and executed.
